All of this is done in Python 3.

This isn't really a 'compiler' since I don't implement stuff like memory management, 
garbade collection, type inferencing, code generation and optimization, but I'm 
going to call it a compiler anyway.


The only thing this project focues on is lexing, parsing and interpreting. There is
a bit of tye checking since there are a couple of primitives.


To use the langauge, read to MyCompiler documentation to get the syntax.
Write the code in a .txt file. To run the code, run the command

python MyCompiler.py ProgramName.txt
