All of this is done in Python 3.

This isn't really a 'compiler' since I don't implement stuff like memory management, 
garbade collection, type inferencing, code generation and optimization, but I'm 
going to call it a compiler anyway.


The only thing this project focues on is lexing, parsing and interpreting. There is
a bit of tye checking since there are a couple of primitives.

All the code is written from scratch. I used resources online and my knowledge from
the compilers and comparative programming course from UCSC, when it was both taught
by Professor Owen Arden.
