All of this is done in Python 3.

This isn't really a 'compiler' since I don't implement stuff like memory management, 
garbade collection, type inferencing, code generation and optimization, but I'm 
going to call it a compiler anyway.


The only thing this project focues on is lexing, parsing and interpreting. There is
a bit of tye checking since there are a couple of primitives.


My goal is to be able to grind leetcode in this lol.


To use the langauge, read to MyCompiler documentation to get the syntax.
Write the code in a .txt file. To run the code, run the command

python MyCompiler.py ProgramName.txt
