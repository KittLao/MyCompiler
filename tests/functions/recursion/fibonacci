The purpose of testing a recursive problem with multiple recursive calls
is to make sure the recursive call isn't dynamically changing the parameter
value 'n' from the previous recursive call. If it was changing it, then the
second recursive call will not recurse because the value of 'n' is already
reduced to it's base case from the first recursive call.

Input:
def fib(n) {if n <=2 then 1 else fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) endif}
var fib_8 = fib(8)
fib_8

Output:
21
