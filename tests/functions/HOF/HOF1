Same as HOF0 except this will test that I can reuse a a function by 
passing it different arguments from what it was originally passed in
to get a different result.

Input:
def func1(a) {
	def func2(b, c) {
		def func3(d, e, f) {
			a * (b + c) * (d + e + f)
		}
	}
}

var call_func1 = func1
var call_func2 = call_func1(1)
var call_func3 = call_func2(2, 4)
call_func3(2, 2, 2)
call_func3(1, 1, 1)

Output:
36
18
